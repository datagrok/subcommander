# Example: If you want to make some variable available to all commands that run
# under your tool, you can edit your context file by hand. But if you want to
# set that up using a script, no need to go mucking about with sed. (I already
# have.) Do this:
#
#     echo "export SPLAT=1" | mytool .saveincontext

out=`mktemp`
cat > "$out"

# TODO: detect that the context file is indeed still written in sh and contains
# the 'exec' line we expect. Don't want to mess with it if someone replaces it
# with something else.

# FIXME: OMG this is soooo ugly. Golf this down into something more elegant.
# And! sed can't understand quotes around the filename? Let's hope it doesn't
# contain spaces.
sed -ie '
/^exec "$@"/,${
	/^exec "$@"/{
		h
		r '"$out"'
		d
	}
	x
	$G
}
' "$SC_CONTEXT/.$SC_MAIN.context"

# clean up the temporary file
rm "$out"
